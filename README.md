# Tableau Project

For this project, I used Tableau to visualize Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilians.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/ukrain-civilian-harm-dataset

The visualizations I created show a map of known attacks, dates, areas targetted, and weapons used (if known).

The charts are also interactive - highlighting any node or data point will provide more details on that facet of the statistic.
